Structure: The main driver function exists in the main.cpp file, this file contains all of the code testing the double linked list methods. The double_linked.cpp and .hpp both contain the code for the double_linked class.

Status: The program works although it has not been tested on CSEGRID.

Development: I developed and tested the code on CLION and replit.

Compiling:
$ make
$ ./HW2.exe
