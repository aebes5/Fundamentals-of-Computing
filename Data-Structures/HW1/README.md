Structure: The main driver function exists in the HW1.cpp file, including the findMax template. The remaining header and implementation files contain the classes that the driver function uses.

Status: The program works completely.

Development: I developed and tested the code in CLION, and then further ran the program through CSE Grid.

Compiling: 
$ make
$ ./HW1.exe
