# Experience using vi:

Overall vi wasn't too bad to use; prior to starting this assignment I had made adjustments to the vimrc file to include preferences that made using vi a lot easier. One thing that would've been nice is if I'd watched the vi tutorial video prior to doing this assignment because there were several times I deleted lines character by character; had I known some simple commands it would've made navigating with vi a lot easier, but nonetheless my experience with vi wasn't bad. I messed around with nano a little bit too throughout the course of this assignment and I'd definitely have to say I prefer using vi. Now having done an assignment with vi and knowing some really simple shortcut commands, using vi in the future should only be easier for me. Adjusting the vimrc to allow for syntax highlighting, show match, tabstop, and line numbers was a game changer helping me catch small mistakes/navigate easier.
